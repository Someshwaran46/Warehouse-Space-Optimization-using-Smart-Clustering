# 📦 Warehouse Space Optimization using Smart Clustering

## 🔍 Project Overview

Modern warehouses manage diverse inventories with significant variation in size, shape, and demand frequency. This project addresses inefficiencies in traditional storage systems by using unsupervised machine learning to dynamically group products for optimal warehouse layout and retrieval speed.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Warehouses often struggle with:

* Inefficient use of space due to inconsistent product sizes.
* Increased order retrieval times due to poor layout planning.
* Static storage systems that don't adapt to changes in product demand.

**Objective:**
Use clustering algorithms to group products based on their **physical dimensions** (Height, Width, Depth) and **Average Daily Demand**, enabling:

* Optimal storage zone assignment.
* Improved picking/packing speed.
* Minimized space wastage.

## 🛠️ Approach

1. **Data Cleaning & Imputation:**
   Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent types.

2. **Feature Scaling:**
   Normalize product dimensions and demand for clustering.

3. **Clustering:**
   Apply **K-Means** to group similar products.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   Use **PCA** and **t-SNE** for cluster visualization.

5. **Cluster Profiling:**
   Analyze cluster characteristics to suggest storage zones.
